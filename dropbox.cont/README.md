dropbox - the container to drop files to me
===========================================

Filenames not preserved (uses upload time instead) in the name of security;

No file retreival possible in the name of privacy.

Installation
------------

Currently it's configured to run behind proxy which serves static sites.
To install it independently, just move/copy files from
`../nginx.cont/data/secure/dropbox.shpakovsky.ru/` to `data/html`

Usage
-----

Navigate friends to http://dropbox.shpakovsky.ru/ (or https) when they want to send a file to you;

Retreive them from dropbox.cont/data/files/ dir:

* File contents is saved in `*.bin` files;

* Original file name you can find in similarly-named `*.txt` files.

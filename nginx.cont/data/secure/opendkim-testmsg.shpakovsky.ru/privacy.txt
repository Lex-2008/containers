Privacy policy for the opendkim-testmsg online tool
===================================================

A friendly reminder: you can always install `opendkim-tools` package on your
system and use `opendkim-testmsg` to do the same as this website does :)

Requests to main page or this privacy policy are not logged.

For the purpose of preventing abuse and checking if this service is used at
all, the following data is stored for each _submitted_ request (i.e. when you
submit the email for testing):
* IP
* Datetime
* User-Agent (browser version)

This data is stored indefinitely. To request data deletion, please kindly
include your IP address(es) or datetime(s) of submitted request(s).

Email is NOT stored, but it might be written to temporary files as part of
usual opendkim-testmsg operation. These files are deleted when opendkim-testmsg
finishes (i.e. when you receive the response, they are already deleted).

Saying that, I still would advise you against submitting sensitive information
into strangers' Internet websites, no matter what they say in their privacy
policy, and consider using opendkim-testmsg yourself.


Worth noting that in order to perform DKIM signature verification, this tool
performs DNS requests, and they might be logged by DNS servers. Usually DKIM
signature is verified as soon as email gets received by destination server -
i.e. within seconds after it was sent, but if someone sent you an email with a
unique "selector" - they might know _when_ you are checking DKIM signature
using this or any other tool.
